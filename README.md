## **Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?**

**Jupyter Notebook with code, experimentation, further insights: [here](https://github.com/pravn20sr/AI-ML-CouponAcceptance/blob/master/AcceptanceCoupon.ipynb)**


### **Goal**
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving.

Analyze the data about if the customer accepts the coupon based on the weather, time of the day, distance between the restaurants, who is travelling along with driver.

##### **Coupons for Bar:**

###### **Inferences:**
* Drivers who visited bar for more than 3 times a month has greater coupon acceptance rate 
* Drivers who are going to bar over the age of 25 years, has more acceptance rate compared to other age groups
* Drivers travelling with passenger not a kid and if the driver is not a widowed, has more acceptance rate

###### ****Next Steps:****
* Target drivers goes to bar for more than once and who doesnot have kids, with more discounted or special coupons
* Target drivers who are more than 25yrs age, give them some special discounts and see if the acceptance rate will be more
* Target drivers with kids by giving different kinds of coupon[restaurent/coffee], and see if the acceptance rate will be more
